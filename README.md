# legged-robots-manipulation
## Introduction
legged-robots-manipulation is a loco-manipulation repository for (wheel-)legged robots. The code is built on  [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym/tree/master). 

*Project Page*:[wheel-legged-loco-manipulation](https://acodedog.github.io/wheel-legged-loco-manipulation/)

The current repository contains airbot ,go2_arx,b2w_z1,aliengo_z1 and b2w. The current repository is a partial implementation of the paper.The repository is still under construction for various reasons, and will be releasing issac lab versions and vision-based versions in the near future.

- [x] legged-robots-manipulation for isaacgym 
- [ ] legged-robots-manipulation for isaaclab
- [ ] end2end vision-based loco-manipulation method

### airbot
airbot is a loco-manipulation task implemented using PPO. It is the baseline for comparison in the Paper.

### go2_arx
go2_arx is a loco-manipulation task implemented using PPO. It is the baseline for comparison in the Paper.

### aliengo_Z1

### B2W_Z1

### b2w
b2w is a locomotion demo for the Unitree b2w robot.
